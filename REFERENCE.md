# Reference (or how to use JavaLess)


## Instalation
I decided export JavaLess to jar file, because it can be easily exported/imported, but I won't update JAR file until I make some big changes. You can easily download/clone and export for yourself (e.g. beta changes).
The lastest official release: https://goo.gl/oG5qoh

Download that Jar and import it to your new project.
#### How?
It's easy to do :). When creating new project click instead of finish to next a on the Libraries tab select "Add External JARs". And then hit Finish.

#### What else?
It's ready to use in your project. Only one thing is necessary. You need to **extend** your main java project and also import JavaLess Package (Ctrl+Shift+O).
For example: 

public class name **extends JavaLess** ....
